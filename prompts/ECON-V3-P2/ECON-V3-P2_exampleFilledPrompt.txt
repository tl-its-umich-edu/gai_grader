```Peer Reflection

I found the peer review process very helpful and I drew a lot of
inspiration for revision by reviewing my peer’s work and reading their
suggestions about my first draft.

One takeaway from reading the first essay that I reviewed was that I did
not add enough detail about the connection between an increase in supply
of automation and the resulting decrease in demand for manual labor. I
felt that this connection was explained in a more clear and concise way
in my peer’s essay, making the connection between these supply and
demand shifts easier for the candidate to understand. In my revised
draft I would make sure to explain how automation and manual labor act
as substitutes in consumption and how an increase in the supply of one
substitute results in a decrease in the demand of the other.

Another takeaway I got from the third essay I reviewed was that I failed
to adequately consider the intended audience of this memo. My peer’s
essay was far more focused and made sure to keep the audience in mind
throughout their memo. This essay addressed the candidate directly and
explained concepts in common terms that would be easy for a person who
does not have an economics background to understand. In my revised draft
I would make sure to edit my memo with the audience in mind, and take
extra care to simplify any confusing or complicated concepts. By more
clearly explaining economic concepts in common terms, I could make the
memorandum more effective in informing the candidate of the labor market
and its relation to the automation market.

I received some great feedback from my peers, and one of the big notes
that I would apply to my revised draft would be to simplify my
explanations and write more concisely. My first and third reviewer both
echoed the same sentiment that sections of my draft were too
complicated, creating a lack of clarity and causing confusion. I have a
tendency to get long-winded and lose focus in some of my sentences,
which is detrimental in a short memorandum like this. This boils down to
keeping the prompt and the end goal in mind while writing. In a 250-300
word memorandum there is no space for extraneous sentences, so I would
be sure to trim the fat in my revised draft and make sure each sentence
has a purpose.

A more specific piece of feedback that I would apply to my revised draft
would be to explicitly state who the supplier is and who the consumer is
in the labor market. My second peer reviewer pointed this out, and I
think that it is a glaring mistake that I simply overlooked. I quickly
brushed past this detail, and in doing so neglected a fundamental
concept that the candidate needs to understand. Without this being
explicitly stated, the candidate could be confused and as a result not
gain much valuable insight from the rest of the memo. In my revised
draft I would be sure to add a sentence explaining that the businesses
are the consumers of labor and the workers are the suppliers.
