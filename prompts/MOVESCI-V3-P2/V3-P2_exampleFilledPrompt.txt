You are a grader for the course "Movement Science". 
Your task is to grade a student's submission for the assignment "CS 1.8b MWrite #1: More Robust Data Collection of Human Gait [Revision & Reflection]" using the provided criteria in the context of this course. 
You will follow these specific rubric criteria to assign points related to different aspects of the assignment.
The assignment's summary is "This is an assignment for revising and reflecting on your writing. In your past assignment, you made a memo to provide recommendations for an experimental protocol that will reduce variability in the data collected during a campus-wide experiment to measure the gait speeds of U-M students. The three most important factors to standardize are: where the start/stop lines should be placed with respect to the gait mat, what instructions should be given to the student walkers before they walk over the gait mat, and the number of trials that should be collected for each included speed. The proposed protocol includes specific recommendations for each of these factors and an explanation of why these recommendations will reduce variability. You will need to make several changes to your response, at the sentence and paragraph level, by taking into consideration the feedback you received and deciding what content you should add, rewrite, or remove from your response. You will also need to explain your reasoning behind your changes. This should be separate from your memo but still on the same document. Summarize the edits you thought were appropriate to make to your writing piece based on the feedback from your peers, your Writing Fellow's comments, or feedback you've received during office hours. Identify areas in your revised memo that benefitted from reading and providing feedback on submissions from your peers. If you choose not to make a suggested change, provide a thorough and respectful rationale explaining why you declined to make the edit.".Each criteria has guidelines used to grade that will inform you on how to make penalties and leave feedback. Use the guidelines per criteria to assign a criteria score and feedback.The points assigned must lie between 0 and the max points as listed for each criteria.
The student's submission is delimited by triple backticks.
The criteria are:
1. Criterion Title: 'Factor 1: Start/Stop Lines', CriterionID: '_3457', Max Points: '3.0', 
Criterion Guidelines: Here we are looking for: 1) a specific recommendation for this factor; 2) an explanation for why you have chosen the specific recommendation and 3) how you think the recommendation will reduce or “control” variability in data collection across the mini gait labs.
Look for specific distance for the start and stop lines and a rationale (i.e. establishing a steady pace)
Give feedback if the distance is not realistic (e.g., say >10 m), then leave a note that this might be a bit long, so think about the size constraints of a space
Deduct if:
-1 pt: Not specific enough (e.g., adjectives only such as “few” “several’ “many” etc.) and we want them to commit
-1 pt: If the rationale is missing or doesn’t align with their distance
-1 pt: If no statement about variability
2. Criterion Title: 'Factor 2: Gait Speeds', CriterionID: '_2149', Max Points: '3.0', 
Criterion Guidelines: Here we are looking for: 1) a specific recommendation for this factor; 2) an explanation for why you have chosen the specific recommendation and 3) how you think the recommendation will reduce or “control” variability in data collection across the mini gait labs.
Look for clarity in what the instructions (protocol) would be and look for students to explain this in a clear way. Ideally want students to identify more than one gait speed, but this might not have been obvious to everyone
Give feedback if explanation is not clear about what to do in terms of the factors, then leave feedback, e.g., be sure to clarify what this means in terms of protocol, e.g., should we not collect data on a windy day or with a backpack?
Looking for clarity in explanations, and if there are elements that don’t connect or are confusing, leave a comment to the students about trying to be clearer and improving the connection; E.g., clarify what we should do in terms of protocols to address this issue
3. Criterion Title: 'Factor 3: Number of Trials', CriterionID: '_7799', Max Points: '3.0', 
Criterion Guidelines: Here we are looking for: 1) a specific recommendation for this factor; 2) an explanation for why you have chosen the specific recommendation and 3) how you think the recommendation will reduce or “control” variability in data collection across the mini gait labs.
Look for clarity in the number of trials and it needs to be more than one trial because of variability. Want them to explain their reasoning in the best way possible so we can understand it and be convinced by it
Deduct if:
-1 pt if there is a need for more clarity in their response in this section
4. Criterion Title: 'Format & Readability', CriterionID: '104689_7513', Max Points: '2.0', 
Criterion Guidelines: Is the response within the word limit (+/- 50 words) and in general memo format? Is it understandable to the intended audience?
Deduct points if:
Look for response within word limit and general memo format
Look for language and explanation that is accessible and understandable
Deduct if:
-0.5 pt: if excessively short or excessively long
-0.5 pt: if structure makes it difficult to follow what is being presented
-0.5 pt: If language that is used could be clearer and/or more understandable to target audience
Leave feedback: try reading aloud to see if there is a way to improve readability; look for ways to be more concise; consider ways to be more specific
5. Criterion Title: 'Revision', CriterionID: '104689_4435', Max Points: '4.0', 
Criterion Guidelines: Revised submission has several changes that address feedback, including from Fellow. 
Here, we are looking for several changes in their work for these points. Ideally, this “several” means three or more changes; however, we didn’t give students this information. So we can leave a comment to encourage them to make additional changes
If a student makes changes based on peer feedback that isn’t correct, then they can still get full feedback for their revisions.
6. Criterion Title: 'Reflection', CriterionID: '136344_3095', Max Points: '5.0', 
Criterion Guidelines: A summary of at least 150 words that addresses your edits and identifies areas in your memo that benefitted from reading and providing feedback on submissions from your peers.
If low on word count and effort - then 2.5 pts out of 5 pts. Partial credit. These would be examples of one sentence / two sentences and not much content

Subject: Experimental Procedures of Gait Speed Data Collection

In conducting this campus wide gait speed data collection, we are
seeking very pertinent information: whether the ten-minute break between
classes is sufficient for students to reach their classes in a timely
manner while walking at their normal pace. It is therefore imperative to
ensure that variability due to experimental procedures, in these gait
speed collections, is as low as possible. With increased error, comes
inaccurate and misleading results and analyses which will in turn affect
the student body. If our data is not measured consistently, this will
lead to the conclusion that the 10-minute break is either sufficient or
not sufficient which will negatively affect the student body or the
administration, respectively.

In order to decrease the chance for error, we will provide a direct
procedure with which to collect the gait speed data. The start and stop
lines will be placed 12 feet before and after the start and stop of the
gait mat, respectively. This will be used to allow each participant the
appropriate time to accelerate and decelerate and to adapt to their
normal walking pace during the trial. 12 feet was chosen because it
represents an average and sufficient distance for participants to
accelerate and decelerate without tiring them out. If you do not allow
for this period to accelerate, then it will result in variable speeds on
the gait mat as students will accelerate when walking on the actual gait
mat. This might mean that the speed with which they walk on the gait mat
will not be their normal pace. If the stop line were to be placed at the
exact stop of the gait mat, then this might cause students to stop
abruptly and not finish walking the entirety of the mat or to slow down,
in anticipation of the end. Providing these stop and start lines will
reduce variability as each student would have the appropriate time to
“warm up” and “cool down” that will ensure that they’re gait speed while
actually on the mat is neither too slow nor too fast. We want to ensure
that we put these procedures in place so that we collect normal or
comfortable walking paces from each student. Students should be using
this pace when walking between classes and our measurements will provide
the data for this.

All students should be instructed to walk at a normal and constant pace,
from the start line to the stop line. Students should be told to imagine
that they are leisurely walking ~~to class~~ and not in a rush. If
students are told this, then this may further push them to walk at their
average pace. If we had told them to imagine walking ~~to class~~
without the indication that they were not in any rush, then, as typical
students, they may speed walk. Other factors such as height affect
normal gait speed so the normal pace of one student may differ from that
of another. Since we will have a random sample of students, these
differences will likely cancel themselves out so providing instructions
to walk at a normal pace is important. These instructions will thus
reduce variability because each student will be walking at their own,
normal pace. This is also important for our study because we want to
ensure that there is sufficient time between classes for students to
walk at a normal pace and not speed-walk or run. We are trying to
collect average walking speed so instructing them to do so will further
reduce variability.

Lastly, each student will perform this action ~~three~~ five times. The
first trial will act as a test-run, in that students will practice
walking on the gait mat and getting used to it. The subsequent next four
trials will be used for the actual data collection and an average will
be computed of the four. The reason for including a test trial is so
that if students make errors, get nervous, or walk too fast or too slow,
we will be able to repeat the previous instructions to them for the next
trials. Four data collection trials are important because more trials
induce less variability and error. It is important that each student
complete the same number of trials so that there is less variability
between each student. With an adequate number of trials, the reliability
of the data will increase, specifically the test-retest reliability, in
which subsequent trials are compared to one another for similarity. When
reliability increases, as does validity which will in turn decrease
potential errors and variability. We will not include more than five
total, however, because we do not want to tire out the students.

Thank you for taking the time to read and follow the instructions above.
They are pertinent to ensure as little variability in our measurements
as possible.

Reflection: In the start/stop lines section, based on the feedback from
my peers and the memos I evaluated myself, I added a reasoning for why
12 feet before and after was specifically chosen. This was because 12
feet (~3m) represents an average distance for individuals to accelerate
and decelerate. I also took the writing fellow’s suggestions into
account: I removed the instructions to “imagine that they are walking to
class” because not everyone walks at the same pace or even their normal
pace to class. Instead, I took out the portion about walking to class
and added that they should walk at a constant pace as well which would
further decrease variability because they would not be speeding up or
slowing down. I also swapped out the word “normal” for “average” which
introduces another speed descriptor that the students can aim for. I
also indicated other factors that can affect one’s normal gait speed –
height – and explained that since we have a random sample if everyone is
given the same instructions to walk at their normal pace then the speeds
will average out. Finally, based on my peer reviews, it was recommended
to include more trials for adequate data and less variability. As the
writing fellow mentioned, I further connected the number of trials to
variability and explained that it increased test-retest reliability and
thus lowered variability.
